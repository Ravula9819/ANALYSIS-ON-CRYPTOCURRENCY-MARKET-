# ANALYSIS-ON-CRYPTOCURRENCY-MARKET

# 📊 Cryptocurrency Data Analysis with Python

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of cryptocurrency price and market data over time. The dataset includes historical pricing details such as open, high, low, close, volume, market cap, and spread for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

## 📁 Dataset Columns

The dataset contains the following features:

- `slug` – Unique identifier for the cryptocurrency  
- `symbol` – Abbreviation of the cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC)  
- `name` – Full name of the cryptocurrency  
- `date` – Date of the record  
- `ranknow` – Market ranking  
- `open`, `high`, `low`, `close` – OHLC prices  
- `volume` – Trading volume  
- `market` – Market capitalization  
- `close_ratio` – Relative closing position in range  
- `spread` – Difference between high and low prices  

## ✅ Tasks Completed

The notebook covers: 
Data exploration (like checking for null values, unique symbols)
Visualizations (line plots, scatter plots, etc.)
Aggregations (monthly averages, top cryptos, etc.)
